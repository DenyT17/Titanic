## Description ‚ùî‚ùì
![Titanic-II-wyplynie-w-rejs-w-2022-roku -Czy-tym-razem-podroz-zakonczy-sie-szczesliwie_article](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122997699/221285433-66d6c0a8-2f9c-4875-ad10-cdfd10f734b5.jpg)

In this project, using the sklearn library, I will create a model thanks to which I will be able to make predictions about whether a given passenger would have survived the sinking of the Titanic.
When accuracy of prediction will be satysficed, I will want to make simple graphical user interface, thanks to which usser will be able to define features of passanger, and prediction his survival.

## Next goals üèÜ‚åõ
* Increasing prediction accuracy as much as possible
* Trying other prediction models 
* Creating graphic user interface
